Installation

1. Get the source
Get the source code by running
$ git clone https://github.com/koyuspace/bloatest

2. Build and install
Install GO from your system's package manager or from https://golang.org/dl.
Then run make to compile the source.
$ make
# make install
This will perform a system wide installation of bloatest. By default, it will
install the binary in /usr/local/bin and data files in /usr/local/share/bloatest.
You can change these paths by editing the Makefile.

3. Edit and copy the config file
Edit the generated config file to you liking and then copy it to the default
config location. Comments in the config file describe what each config value 
does. For most cases, you only need to change the value of "client_website".
$ $EDITOR bloatest.def.conf
# cp bloatest.def.conf /etc/bloatest.conf

4. Create database directory
Create a directory to store session information. Optionally, create a user
to run bloatest and change the ownership of the database directory accordingly.
# mkdir /var/bloatest
# useradd _bloatest
# chown -R _bloatest:_bloatest /var/bloatest
Replace /var/bloatest with the value you specified in the config file.

5. Run the binary
# su _bloatest -c bloatest
Now you should create an init script to automatically start bloatest at system 
startup.


Update

Either run git pull to fetch the updated source or download the latest tarball
from the URL mentioned in the installation step. Then run make to install the
updated binary and data files
$ git pull
$ make 
# make install


Note: Commands starting with # are to be is to run as root.
